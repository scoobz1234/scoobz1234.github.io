    <b>BACKLOG</b><br>
    Added Group Member : Amanda Nielsen<br>
    <b>Sprint 1:</b> <br>
    We had to modify our sprint to ensure each member had a sufficient
    amount of work and ensure there was enough work to go around.
    What this ended up doing is modifying our scope, and in return our scope was broadened.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Backlog:</b><br>
    <b>Ryan</b> - Create SQL database tables and schemas (barebones)<br>
    <b>Stephen</b> - Setup SQL server, Git hub, and C# project. Also to create the Connection Class in said project.<br>
    <b>Amanda</b> - Being barebones GUI for application.<br>
    <b>Yasmin</b> - Start and complete barebones website access to database (online form of application)<br>

    <b>STANDUP</b><br>
    <b>What did I work on last?</b><br>
    This week I have created the Visual Studio Project file and pushed it to the GitHub.
    I created the GitHub repo and gave all group members access.
    I created the SQL server, and setup hosting and user access for all members.
    I created a Connection Class in C# that enables users to perform Queries from the SQL database.<br>

    <b>What will I work on next?</b><br>
    I will be splitting the Query part of the Connection class into its own class and ensuring this class can be
    modified by the user depending on user access rights. This means that i will work with Ryan to
    start populating the database with faux users, and then test accessibility with the program.<br>

    <b>What is standing in my way (obstacles) and what challenges have I overcome?</b><br>
    Need to make sure that the GUI is on its way that way i can start tying in the classes
    to the forms components such as buttons and input fields.<br>

    <b>How are we doing?</b><br>
    so far so good, we have had some issues with communication with all members,
    but we are getting a good grasp on when we are all available and can meet virtually.

        <b>BACKLOG</b><br>
        Group Project: Therapy Buddy "Never drop the soap again!"<br>
        <b>Sprint 2:</b> <br>
        We played catch up this week. Spent some time getting all the team members on par with our ideas and plans.
        We worked on UI Creation, Functions, and design this week.
        I was able to modify the Connection class for more stability and
        began writing out the Methods for performing custom queries withing C# to the SQL database.
        I spent most of my week juggling my SIP fiasco and this project, and because of that I
        feel that my focus on this project fell on the back burner.
        I have completed my work but my communication this week was spotty.<br>

        <b>Backlog:</b><br>
        <b>Stephen</b> -Split Query class, being population of database, finish database connection class<br>

        <b>What did I work on last?</b><br>
        The last thing i worked on was the Sprint demonstration videos,
        and Deploying the application for windows installation. Overall this was a complete success.<br>

        <b>What will I work on next?</b><br>
        Next sprint I will be creating / finishing methods that will allow us to perform unique
        queries from different forms in the application, ranging from Therapist schedules to SOAP notes.
        I will be building the UI as needed to implement these methods.<br>

        <b>What is standing in my way (obstacles) and what challenges have I overcome?</b><br>
        Mostly time management, last week was a bit rough but I have 100% focus on this project now. We will get this done!!!<br>

        <b>How are we doing?</b><br>
        Now that everyone is on the same page, and we have worked out small problems here and there,
        our communication has improved and we are ready to knock out the rest of this application.

        <b>BACKLOG</b><br>
        Group Project: Therapy Buddy "Never drop the soap again!"<br>

        <b>Stephen</b> -Split Query class, being population of database, finish database connection class<br>

        <b>What did I work on last?</b><br>
        Began changes in the GUI system to allow for fluidity and ease of access. Added some fun extra transitions
        while i was at it. Modified the connection class once again and began the methods for more custom
        SQL commands and queries. built a few new gui windows, added code, refactored/renamed all form components.<br>

        <b>What will I work on next?</b><br>
        This week will be focusing on buttoning up the application and
        finalizing reports and other functions that are built but have not been implemented.<br>

        <b>What is standing in my way (obstacles) and what challenges have I overcome?</b><br>
        This weeks challenges for myself was being ill come Friday and into the weekend,
        as well as my 4 kids and wife. So in between caring for everyone and myself,
        i had to find the time to get my work done for this project. Obstacles that are in the way
        are essentially non existent at the moment as we have solidified our communication hiccups and are moving along smoothly.<br>

        <b>How are we doing?</b><br>
        5 stars for doing a bangup job! team is working well together as well as communicating well.
